### Explanation

    This program implements a basic token bucket algorithm for managing the flow of packets. Let's go through the program step by step:

    1. The necessary header files (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `stdbool.h`, `unistd.h`) are included.

    2. The constant `OUTPUT_RATE` is defined, representing the number of packets that can be processed per second.

    3. The `main()` function begins.

    4. The user is prompted to enter the bucket capacity by using `printf()` and `scanf()`. The entered value is stored in the variable `BUCKET_CAPACITY`.

    5. The variable `bucket_size` is initialized to 0, representing the current number of tokens in the bucket.

    6. The program enters an infinite loop using `while (true)`.

    7. Inside the loop, the variable `incoming_packets` is assigned a random value between 0 and 4 (inclusive) using `rand() % 5`. This simulates the arrival of packets.

    8. The number of incoming packets is printed to the console using `printf()`.

    9. The incoming packets are added to the bucket by incrementing `bucket_size`.

    10. The program checks if the bucket is overflowing by comparing `bucket_size` with `BUCKET_CAPACITY`.

    11. If the bucket is overflowing, it means there are more tokens than the bucket can hold. The excess packets are dropped, and the number of dropped packets is printed to the console using `printf()`. The `bucket_size` is then set to the maximum capacity, `BUCKET_CAPACITY`.

    12. If the bucket is not overflowing, the program checks if there are tokens in the bucket (`bucket_size > 0`).

    13. If there are tokens in the bucket, the program calculates the number of outgoing packets as the minimum value between `bucket_size` and `OUTPUT_RATE`. This ensures that the program does not process more packets than the output rate allows.

    14. The number of outgoing packets is printed to the console using `printf()`.

    15. The outgoing packets are subtracted from the bucket by decrementing `bucket_size` accordingly.

    16. The program waits for 1 second using `sleep(1)` to simulate the passage of time.

    17. The loop repeats from step 7.

    This program essentially emulates a token bucket algorithm, where tokens (packets) arrive randomly and are added to the bucket. If the bucket overflows, packets are dropped. The program then processes a limited number of packets based on the output rate. The loop continues indefinitely, simulating the continuous flow of packets.
