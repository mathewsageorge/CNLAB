### Explanation
    This modified code implements an interactive version of the token bucket algorithm, allowing the user to manually process incoming and outgoing packets. Let's go through the code step by step:

    1. The necessary header files (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `stdbool.h`, `unistd.h`) are included.

    2. The constant `BUCKET_CAPACITY` is defined, representing the maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold.

    3. The constant `OUTPUT_RATE` is defined, representing the number of tokens that can be processed per second.

    4. Two functions are declared: `processIncomingPackets()` and `processOutgoingPackets()`. These functions handle the processing of incoming and outgoing packets, respectively. They take a pointer to the `bucket_size` variable as a parameter, allowing them to modify the bucket size directly.

    5. The `processIncomingPackets()` function prompts the user to enter the number of incoming packets using `printf()` and `scanf()`. The entered value is stored in the `incoming_packets` variable.

    6. The number of incoming packets is printed to the console using `printf()`.

    7. The incoming packets are added to the bucket by incrementing the value of `bucket_size`.

    8. The function checks if the bucket is overflowing by comparing `bucket_size` with `BUCKET_CAPACITY`.

    9. If the bucket is overflowing, it means there are more tokens than the bucket can hold. The excess packets are dropped, and the number of dropped packets is printed to the console using `printf()`. The `bucket_size` is then set to the maximum capacity, `BUCKET_CAPACITY`.

    10. The `processOutgoingPackets()` function is similar to the previous function, but it handles outgoing packets. It checks if there are tokens in the bucket (`bucket_size > 0`).

    11. If there are tokens in the bucket, the function calculates the number of outgoing packets as the minimum value between `bucket_size` and `OUTPUT_RATE`. This ensures that the program does not process more packets than the output rate allows.

    12. The number of outgoing packets is printed to the console using `printf()`.

    13. The outgoing packets are subtracted from the bucket by decrementing `bucket_size` accordingly.

    14. If there are no tokens in the bucket, a message is printed to indicate underflow (`printf("No outgoing packets.Bucket Underflow!!\n")`).

    15. The `main()` function begins.

    16. Inside the `while (true)` loop, a menu is displayed to the user using `printf()`. The user is prompted to enter a choice (1 for processing incoming packets, 2 for processing outgoing packets, and 3 to exit).

    17. The user's choice is stored in the `choice` variable using `scanf()`.

    18. A switch statement is used to execute the appropriate function based on the user's choice.

    19. If the user chooses 1, the `processIncomingPackets()` function is called, passing the address of `bucket_size` so that it can modify the bucket size.

    20. If the user chooses 2, the `processOutgoingPackets()` function is called, again passing the address of `bucket_size`.

    21. If the user chooses 3, a message is printed to indicate the program is exiting, and the `exit(0)` function is called to terminate the program.

    22. If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed (`printf("Invalid choice. Try again.\n")`).

    23. The program waits for 1 second using `sleep(1)` to simulate the passage of time.

    24. The loop repeats from step 15.

    This modified code allows the user to interactively control the flow of incoming and outgoing packets, providing more flexibility compared to the original program.
